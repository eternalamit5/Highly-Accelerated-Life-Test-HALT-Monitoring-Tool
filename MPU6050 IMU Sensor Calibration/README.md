# IMU SENSOR CALIBRATION

The objective of the accelerometer and gyroscope calibration experiment is to propose a method to find the acceleration offset present in the IMU sensor. Usually, offsets are present due to number of reasons like:

• Offset in the MEMS sensor which is present during sensor fabrication itself.
• Offset created due to wafer-level bonding or soldering the MEMS sensor on the wafer.
• Offset due to the placement of the wafer on a flat surface.
